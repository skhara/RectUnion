Another job applicant's task :)
Make a program that calculates square of a shape made of multiple unioned rectangles with side maximum length
of 10000 points. The number of unioned rectangles can be within 100.
The memory limit should be within 16 megabytes.

java.util.BitSet seemed to be the appropriate structure for union operations

Compilation:
Run 'mvn package' maven command from the project's root folder (where pom.xml is located). 
The executable jar will be created and put into ./target folder
	Or 
Import project into IDE and assemble it with IDE's tools

Running:

You should provide an input text file (with 'input.txt' as a default name ), with each line having two pairs of x,y coordinates - top left
and bottom right coordinates of a rectangle.
The program reads a line, creates a rectangle and unions it with a previous one. At the end it outputs
the square of a shape made by those rectangles into the output text file (with 'output.txt' as a default name).

Having executable jar assembled, run it with command: 
    'java -jar ./folder-with-assembled-jar/testApp.jar input.txt output.txt'. 
If jar is assembled with maven it should be located in './target' folder, so you can run it with:
    'java -jar ./target/testApp.jar input.txt output.txt'
